{question: `And all will be happy, all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `Because we looked at the world for thousands of years with moral, aesthetic, religious demands, with blind inclination, passion, or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually become so wondrously multicolored, terrible, meaningful, soulful, that it has taken on color—but we have been the colorists.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `God is dead! God remains dead! And we killed him!`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `Oh, we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love us like children because we allow them to sin.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},

{question: `We shall show them that they are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `But everything so far that has made metaphysical assumptions valuable, frightful, delightful, is passion, error, and self-deception—the worst methods of attaining knowledge, not the very best, have taught us to believe in them.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `...the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only hunger?`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `Everything, however, became what it is. There are no eternal facts. There are no absolute truths.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `there is nothing more terrible than infinity.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `Morals have an influence on actions and affections. Reason alone can have no such influence. So, morality is not a conclusion of reason.`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `The imagination cannot conceive a viler criminal than he who should build another London like the present one, nor a greater benefactor than he who should destroy it.`, answer: "Shaw"},

{question: `Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!" that's what they'll write on the banner....`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `And the most tragic problem of philosophy is to reconcile intellectual necessities with the necessities of the heart and the will. For it is on this rock that every philosophy that pretends to resolve the eternal and tragic contradiction, the basis of our existence, breaks to pieces.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `Man is an end, not a means. All civilization addresses itself to man, to each man, to each I.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `But we are coming now to realize that life is so complicated that we are not dealing with the old conditions, and that the law has to step in and create new conditions under which we may live, the conditions which will make it tolerable for us to live.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `What it liberty? You say of the locomotive that it runs free. What do you mean? You mean that its parts are so assembled and adjusted that friction is reduced to a minimum, and that it has perfect adjustment.`, answer: "Wilson"},

{question: `We have changed our economic conditions, absolutely, from top to bottom; and, with our economic society, the organization of our life.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `Contradiction! Of course! Since we only live in and by contradictions, since life is tragedy and the tragedy is perpetual struggle, without victory or the hope of victory, life is contradiction.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `The man of flesh and bone; the man who is born, suffers, and dies—above all, who dies; the man who eats and drinks and plays and sleeps and thinks and wills; the man who is seen and heard; the brother, the real brother.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `. . .’tis the object of feeling, not of reason. It lies in yourself, not in the object.`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `I am a man; no other man do I deem a stranger.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `I have long had an image in my mind of what constitutes liberty. Suppose that I were building a great piece of powerful machinery, and suppose that I should so awkwardly and unskilfully assemble the parts of it that every time one part tried to move it would be interfered with by the others, and the whole thing would buckle up and be checked. Liberty for the several parts would consist in the best possible assembling and adjustment of them all, would it not? If you want the great piston of the engine to run with absolute freedom, give it absolutely perfect alignment and adjustment with the other parts of the machine, so that it is free, not because it is let alone or isolated, but because it has been associated most skilfully and carefully with the other parts of the great structure.`, answer: "Wilson"},

{question: `Marriage is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice. Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life, not of mechanics; it must develop.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `So far as I am concerned, I will never willingly yield myself, nor entrust my confidence, to any popular leader who is not penetrated with the feeling that he who orders a people orders men, men of flesh and bone, men who are born, suffer, and, although they do not wish to die, die; men who are ends in themselves, not merely means; men who must be themselves and not others; men, in fine, who seek that which we call happiness.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `And thus, in a philosopher, what must needs most concern us is the man.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `For the secret of man’s being is not only to live but to have something to live for.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `It is perfectly clear to every man who has any vision of the immediate future, who can forecast any part of it from the indications of the present, that we are just upon the threshold of a time when the systematic life of this country will be sustained, or at least supplemented, at every point by governmental activity.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `We lie under the network of arching shells and live in a suspense of uncertainty. Over us Chance hovers.`, answer: "Remarque"},
{question: `...in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `I had not thought death had undone so many.`, answer: "Eliot"},
{question: `A rat crept softly through the vegetation&nbsp;Dragging its slimy belly on the bank&nbsp;While I was fishing in the dull canal&nbsp;On a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the king my brother's wreck&nbsp;And on the king my father's death before him.`, answer: "Eliot"},
{question: `Philosophy answers to our need of forming a complete and unitary conception of the world and of life, and as a result of this conception, a feeling which gives birth to an inward attitude and even to outward action.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `What if this chemistry would reveal that in these areas too the most glorious colors arise from low, despised materials?`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property.`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold....`, answer: "Yeats"},
{question: `For having begun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course, with cannibalism.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `All that progressives ask or desire is permission—in an era when "development," "evolution," is the scientific word—to interpret the Constitution according to the Darwinian principle; all they ask is recognition of the fact that a nation is a living thing and not a machine.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views and conceptions, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `Shall I at least set my lands in order?`, answer: "Eliot"},

{question: `The darkness drops again; but now I know&nbsp;That twenty centuries of stony sleep&nbsp;Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle....`, answer: "Yeats"},
{question: `No living thing can have its organs offset against each other, as checks, and live. On the contrary, its life is dependent upon their quick co-operation, their ready response to the commands of instinct or intelligence, their amicable community of purpose. Government is not a body of blind forces; it is a body of men, with highly differentiated functions, no doubt, in our modern day, of specialization, with a common task and purpose. Their co-operation is indispensable, their warfare fatal. There can be no successful government without the intimate, instinctive co-ordination of the organs of life and action.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `We could never regain the old intimacy with those scenes. It was not any recognition of their beauty and their significance that attracted us, but the communion, the feeling of a comradeship with the things and events of our existence, which cut us off and made the world of our parents a thing incomprehensible to us--for then we surrendered ourselves to events and were lost in them, and the least little thing was enough to carry us down the stream of eternity.`, answer: "Remarque"},
{question: `It is this Chance that makes us indifferent.`, answer: "Remarque"},
{question: `You cannot say, or guess, for you know only&nbsp;A heap of broken images....`, answer: "Eliot"},

{question: `Reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions.`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `In every system of morality I have met with I have noticed that the author proceeds for some time reasoning in the ordinary way to establish the existence of a God, or making points about human affairs, and then he suddenly surprises me by moving from propositions with the usual copula ‘is’ (or ‘is not’) to ones that are connected by ‘ought’ (or ‘ought not’).`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `This seems like a very small change, but it is highly important. For as this ‘ought’ (or ‘ought not’) expresses some new relation or affirmation, it needs to be pointed out and explained; and a reason should be given for how this new relation can be—inconceivably!—a deduction from others that are entirely different from it.`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `Reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions.`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `What do you believe?—This: that the weights of all things must be determined afresh.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `Everything that we need and which can be given to us only now that the individual sciences have reached their present height, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, and aesthetic conceptions and sensations.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `How can something develop from its opposite—for example, reason from the unreasonable, feeling from the dead, logic from the illogical, disinterested gaze from covetous wanting, altruism from egoism, truth from error?`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `They are little children rioting and barring out the teacher at school.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `Activity is the only road to knowledge.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `For as this ‘ought’ (or ‘ought not’) expresses some new relation or affirmation, it needs to be pointed out and explained....`, answer: "Hume"},
{question: `Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `Everything that philosophers say about man is no longer fundamental, but tells us something about the men of a very limited period of time.`, answer: "Nietzsche"},
{question: `...that's their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It's simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination---something like a universal serfdom with them as masters---that's all they stand for.`, answer: "Dostoevsky"},
{question: `They tell me I am here to realize I know not what social end; but I feel that I, like each one of my fellows, am here to realize myself, to live.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `We think of the future, not the past, as the more glorious time in comparison with which the present is nothing. Progress, development,—those are modern words. The modern idea is to leave the past and press onward to something new.`, answer: "Wilson"},

{question: `If you injure your neighbor, better not do it by halves.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `The values we are discussing are, as you see, values of the heart, and against values of the heart reasons do not avail. For reasons are only reasons—that is to say, they are not even truths.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `There is a psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret 
dreams. If this procedure is employed, every dream reveals itself as a psychical 
structure which has a meaning and which can be inserted at an assignable point in the mental activities of 
waking life.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `I shall further endeavor to elucidate the processes to which the strangeness and 
obscurity of dreams are due and to deduce from those processes the nature of the psychical 
forces by whose concurrent or mutually opposing action 
dreams are generated.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `When the work of interpretation 
has been completed, we 
perceive that a dream is the 
fulfillment of a wish.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `They are psychical phenomena of complete validity—fulfillments of wishes; they can be inserted into the chain of intelligible waking mental acts; they are constructed by a highly complicated activity of the mind`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `What do geese dream of? Of maize.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `But in cases where the wish-fulfillment is unrecognizable, where 
it has been disguised, there must have existed some inclination to 
put up a defence against the wish; and owing to this defence the 
wish was unable to express itself except in a distorted shape`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `the aim of all life is death.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `The price we pay for our advance in 
civilization is a loss of happiness through a 
heightening of the sense of guilt.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `Psychoanalysis is justly suspicious. One of its rules is that whatever interrupts the progress of 
analytic work is a resistance.`, answer: "Freud"},
{question: `Drama is action, sir, action and 
not confounded philosophy.`, answer: "Pirandello"},

{question: `Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (I am a human being, I consider nothing human alien to me)`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `Man is said to be a reasoning animal. I do not know why he has not been defined as an affective or feeling animal. Perhaps that which differentiates him from other animals is feeling rather than reason. More often I have seen a cat reason than laugh or weep.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `And thus, in a philosopher, what must needs most concern us is the man.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `Man is an end, not a means. All civilization addresses itself to man, to each man, to each I.`, answer: "Unamuno"},
{question: `Contradiction! Of course! Since we only live in and by contradictions, since life is tragedy and the tragedy is perpetual struggle, without victory or the hope of victory, life is contradiction.`, answer: "Unamuno"},

{question: `Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken....`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},

hope of good in any radical changes.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `Man everywhere has an unconquerable
desire to be the master of his own destiny.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable
rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers
from the consent of the governed, that is
final. No advance, no progress can be made
beyond these propositions.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `About the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly
restful. It is often asserted that the world has made a great
deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts
and new experiences which have given us a great advance
over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very
well discard their conclusions for something more modern.
But that reasoning can not be applied to this great charter.`, answer: "Wilson"},
{question: `If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only
direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but
backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights
of the individual, no rule of the people. Those who wish to
proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress. They are
reactionary. Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient,
than those of the Revolutionary fathers.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `In the development of its institutions America can fairly claim
that it has remained true to the principles which were
declared 150 years ago. In all the essentials we have achieved
an equality which was never possessed by any other people.
Even in the less important matter of material possessions we
have secured a wider and wider distribution of wealth.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `Yes, makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleepIs cheaper than them uniforms, an' they're starvation cheap;An' hustlin' drunken soldiers when they're goin' large a bitIs five times better business than paradin' in full kit.

• In strength lift up your hand.’`, answer: "Kipling"},
{question: `If there is a first virtue of
a civilization, it is survival`, answer: "Kipling"},
{question: `It is said that every people has the Government it deserves. It is more to the point that every Government has the electorate it deserves; for the orators of the front bench can edify or debauch an ignorant electorate at will. Thus our democracy moves in a vicious circle of reciprocal worthiness and unworthiness.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `He who confuses political liberty with freedom and political equality with similarity has never thought for five minutes about either.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `Nothing can be unconditional: consequently nothing can be free.`, answer: "Shaw"},

{question: `Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.`, answer: "Shaw"},
{question: `Why appeal to the mob when ninety-five per cent of them do not understand politics, and can do nothing but mischief without leaders? And what sort of leaders do they vote for? For Titus Oates and Lord George Gordon with their Popish plots, for Hitlers who call on them to exterminate Jews, for Mussolinis who rally them to nationalist dreams of glory and empire in which all foreigners are enemies to be subjugated.`, answer: "Shaw"},

{question: `And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;Departed, have left no addresses. By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept...Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or

{question: `Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not
indeed a 'character,' is yet the most important
personage in the poem, uniting all the rest.
Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of
currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and
the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand,
Prince of Naples, so all the women are one
woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.
What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance
of the poem.`, answer: "Eliot"},

{question: `Man is said to be a reasoning animal. I do not know why he has not been defined as an affective or feeling animal. Perhaps that which differentiates him from other animals is feeling rather than reason. More often I have seen a cat reason than laugh or weep.

{question: `government is not a machine, but a living thing. It falls, not under the theory of the universe, but under the theory of organic life. It is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton.

{question: `I think that life is a very sad piece of buffoonery; because we have in ourselves, 
without being able to know why, wherefore or whence, the need to deceive 
ourselves constantly by creating a reality (one for each and never the same 
for all), which from time to time is discovered to be vain and illusory…. My 
art is full of bitter compassion for all those who deceive themselves; but this 
compassion cannot fail to be followed by the ferocious derision of destiny which 
condemns man to deception.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `You represent the shell of the eggs you are beating!`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `The empty 
form of reason without the fullness of instinct, which is blind." -- You stand for 
reason, your wife is instinct. It's a mixing up of the parts, according to which you 
who act your own part become the puppet of yourself.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Oh sir, you know well that life is full of 
infinite absurdities, which, strangely enough, do not even need to 
appear plausible, since they are true.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `I say that to reverse the ordinary process may well 
be considered a madness: that is, to create credible situations, 
in order that they may appear true. But permit me to 
observe that if this be madness, it is the sole raison d'être of 
your profession, gentlemen.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Well, to make seem true that which isn't true . . . 
without any need . . . for a joke as it were . . . Isn't that your 
mission, gentlemen: to give life to fantastic characters on the 
stage?`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Each of us when he appears before his fellows is clothed in a certain 
dignity. But every man knows what unconfessable things pass within the 
secrecy of his own heart. One gives way to the temptation, only to rise from it 
again, afterwards, with a great eagerness to re-establish one's dignity, as if it were 
a tombstone to place on the grave of one's shame, and a monument to hide and 
sign the memory of our weaknesses. Everybody's in the same case. Some folks 
haven't the courage to say certain things, that's all!`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `[All] this philosophy that uncovers the beast in man, and then seeks to 
save him, excuse him . . . I can't stand it, sir. When a man seeks to "simplify" 
life bestially, throwing aside every relic of humanity, every chaste aspiration, 
every pure feeling, all sense of ideality, duty, modesty, shame . . . then nothing is 
more revolting and nauseous than a certain kind of remorse -- crocodiles' tears, 
that's what it is.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `For the drama lies all in this -- in the conscience that I have, that 
each one of us has. We believe this conscience to be a single thing, but it is 
many-sided. There is one for this person, and another for that. Diverse 
consciences.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `So we have this illusion of being one person for all, of having a personality that 
is unique in all our acts. But it isn't true. We perceive this when, tragically 
perhaps, in something we do, we are as it were, suspended, caught up in the air 
on a kind of hook. Then we perceive that all of us was not in that act, and that 
it would be an atrocious injustice to judge us by that action alone, as if all our 
existence were summed up in that one deed.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `we too find ourselves strange to one another. We 
find we are living in an atmosphere of mortal desolation which is 
the revenge, as he [Indicating SON.] scornfully said of the Demon of 
Experiment, that unfortunately hides in me.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Thus, sir, you see when faith is lacking, it becomes impossible to create 
certain states of happiness, for we lack the necessary humility. 
Vaingloriously, we try to substitute ourselves for this faith, creating thus for 
the rest of the world a reality which we believe after their fashion, while, 
actually, it doesn't exist. For each one of us has his own reality to be 
respected before God, even when it is harmful to one's very self.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Then why not turn author now? 
Everybody does it.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Truth up to a certain 
point, but no further.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `But only in order to know if you, as you really are now, 
see yourself as you once were with all the illusions that were yours 
then, with all the things both inside and outside of you as they 
seemed to you -- as they were then indeed for you.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `all this present reality of yours -- is fated to 
seem a mere illusion to you tomorrow?`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Every true man, sir, who is a 
little above the level of the beasts and plants does not live for the 
sake of living, without knowing how to live; but he lives so as to 
give a meaning and a value of his own to life`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `There is someone who is living my life. And I know nothing about him.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `The ruling ideas of an age are the ideas of its 
ruling class`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `THERE is one fact which, whether for 
good or ill, is of utmost importance in the 
public life of Europe at the present 
moment. This fact is the accession of the 
masses to complete social power.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Such has public power always been when exercised directly by the 
masses: omnipotent and ephemeral. The mass-man is he whose life lacks any purpose, and simply goes 
drifting along.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `the mass believes that it 
has the right to impose and 
to give force of law to 
notions born in the cafe.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `The old democracy was tempered by a generous dose of liberalism 
and of enthusiasm for law. By serving these principles the individual bound himself to maintain 
a severe discipline over himself. Under the shelter of liberal principles and the rule of law, minorities 
could live and act. Democracy and law— life in common under the law— were 
synonymous. Today we are witnessing the triumphs of a hyperdemocracy in 
which the mass acts directly, outside the law, imposing its aspirations 
and its desires by means of material pressure`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `In the schools, which were such a source of pride to the last 
century, it has been impossible to do more than instruct the masses 
in the technique of modern life; it has been found impossible to 
educate them. They have been given tools for an intenser form of 
existence, but no feeling for their great historic duties; they have 
been hurriedly inoculated with the pride and power of modern 
instruments, but not with their spirit. Hence they will have nothing 
to do with their spirit, and the new generations are getting ready to 
take over command of the world as if the world were a paradise 
without trace of former footsteps, without traditional and highly 
complex problems.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `who are placing in imminent danger those very principles to which 
they owe their existence. If that human type continues to be master in Europe, thirty years 
will suffice to send our continent back to barbarism.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `For, in fact, the common man, finding himself in 
a world so excellent, technically and socially, 
believes that it has been produced by nature, and 
never thinks of the personal efforts of highlyendowed individuals which the creation of this 
new world presupposed.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Still less will he admit the notion 
that all these facilities still require 
the support of certain difficult 
human virtues, the least failure of 
which would cause the rapid 
disappearance of the whole 
magnificent edifice.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Thus is explained and defined the absurd state of mind revealed by 
these masses; they are only concerned with their own well-being, 
and at the same time they remain alien to the cause of that well-being. As they do not see, behind the benefits of civilisation, marvels 
of invention and construction which can only be maintained by great 
effort and foresight, they imagine that their role is limited to 
demanding these benefits peremptorily, as if they were natural 
rights.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `In the disturbances caused 
by scarcity of food, the mob 
goes in search of bread, and 
the means it employs is 
generally to wreck the 
bakeries.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `The ‘ideas’ of the average man are not genuine ideas, 
nor is their possession culture. An idea is a putting 
truth in checkmate. Whoever wishes to have ideas 
must first prepare himself to desire truth and to accept 
the rules of the game imposed by it. It is no use 
speaking of ideas when there is no acceptance of a 
higher authority to regulate them, a series of standards 
to which it is possible to appeal in a discussion. These 
standards are the principles on which culture rests.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Barbarism is the absence of standards 
to which appeal can be made.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Under the species of Syndicalism and 
Fascism there appears for the first time 
in Europe a type of man who does not 
want to give reasons or to be right, but 
simply shows himself resolved to 
impose his opinions. This is the new 
thing: the right not to be reasonable, 
the ‘reason of unreason.’`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Civilisation is before all, the will to live in 
common. A man is uncivilised, barbarian in 
the degree in which he does not take others 
into account. Barbarism is the tendency to 
disassociation. Accordingly, all barbarous epochs have been 
times of human scattering, of the pullulation 
of tiny groups, separate from and hostile to 
one another.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Share our existence with the enemy! Govern with the opposition! 
Is not such a form of tenderness beginning to seem 
incomprehensible? The mass— who would credit it as one sees its compact, 
multitudinous appearance?— does not wish to share life with those 
who are not of it. It has a deadly hatred of all that is not itself.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `I am myself and my circumstance`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `our existence is at every instant and 
primarily the consciousness of what is 
possible to us`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `To say that we live is the same as saying 
that we find ourselves in an atmosphere of 
definite possibilities. This atmosphere we 
generally call our ‘circumstances.’`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `The world is the sum-total of our vital 
possibilities.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `Surprising condition, this, of our 
existence! To live is to feel 
ourselves fatally obliged to exercise 
our liberty, to decide what we are 
going to be in this world.`, answer: "Ortega"},
{question: `The idea of authority, which they represented, was associated in our minds with a greater insight and a more humane wisdom. But the first death we saw shattered this belief. We had to recognise that our generation was more to be trusted than theirs.`, answer: "Remarque"},
{question: `The things of the spirit come first. Unless we cling to that, all our material prosperity, overwhelming though it may appear, will turn to a barren sceptre in our grasp.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too....`, answer: "Kipling"},
{question: `That is no country for old men.`, answer: "Yeats"},
{question: `It is not so much, then, for the purpose of undertaking to proclaim new theories and principles that this annual celebration is maintained, but rather to reaffirm and reestablish those old theories and principles which time and the unerring logic of events have demonstrated to be sound.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `I don't want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again.`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `As an endless dream it went on; the spirit of the past brooding over a new generation, the chosen youth from the muddled, unchastened world, still fed romantically on the mistakes and half-forgotten dreams of dead statesmen and poets.`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics, every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States with the assurance and confidence that those two great charters of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim....`, answer: "Kipling"},
{question: `Each of us when he appears before his fellows is clothed in a certain&nbsp;dignity. But every man knows&nbsp;what unconfessable things pass within the secrecy of his own heart.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `Placing every man on a plane where he acknowledged no superiors, where no one possessed any right to rule over him, he must inevitably choose his own rulers through a system of self-government.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `I'm not sure about good and evil at all any more.`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `He began for the first time in his life to have a strong distrust of all generalities and epigrams. They were too easy, too dangerous to the public mind. Yet all thought usually reached the public after thirty years in some such form: Benson and Chesterton had popularized Huysmans and Newman; Shaw had sugar-coated Nietzsche and Ibsen and Schopenhauer. The man in the street heard the conclusions of dead genius through some one else's clever paradoxes and didactic epigrams.`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.`, answer: "Marx"},
{question: `They preached equality because they believed in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. They justified freedom by the text that we are all created in the divine image, all partakers of the divine spirit.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `...he lives so as to give a meaning and a value of his own to life.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `There is far more danger of harm than there is hope of good in any radical changes.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken....`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `There is far more danger of harm than there is hope of good in any radical changes. `, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `I think that life is a very sad piece of buffoonery; because we have in&nbsp;ourselves, without being able to know why, wherefore or whence,&nbsp;the need to deceive ourselves constantly by creating a reality&nbsp;(one for each and never the same for all),&nbsp;which from time to time is discovered to be vain and illusory.`, answer: "Pirandello"},
{question: `The people have to bear their own responsibilities. There is no method by which that burden can be shifted to the government.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions.`, answer: "Coolidge"},
{question: `Progress was a labyrinth ... people plunging blindly in and then rushing wildly back, shouting that they had found it....`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `There were no more wise men; there were no more heroes....`, answer: "Fitzgerald"},
{question: `Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, 
nothing against the state.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `No individuals or groups (political parties, cultural associations, 
economic unions, social classes) outside the State.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `The Fascist conception of the State is all 
embracing; outside of it no human or 
spiritual values can exist, much less have 
value. Thus understood, Fascism, is 
totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a 
synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values
—interprets, develops, and potentates the 
whole life of a people.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life 
stresses the importance of the State and 
accepts the individual only in so far as his 
interests coincide with those of the State, which 
stands for the conscience and the universal, 
will of man as a historic entity.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `Outside history man is a nonentity. Fascism is 
therefore opposed to all individualistic abstractions based 
on eighteenth century materialism…. It does not 
believe in the possibility of ‘happiness’ on earth as 
conceived by the economistic literature of the 
XVIIIth century….`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `Fascism reasserts the rights of the State 
as expressing the real essence of the 
individual.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `And if liberty is to be the attribute of living 
men and not of abstract dummies invented 
by individualistic liberalism, then Fascism 
stands for liberty, and for the only liberty 
worth having, the liberty of the State and of the 
individual within the State.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `Fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines 
of [classical] liberalism, both in the political and the economic 
sphere.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `If the XIXth century was the century of the individual 
(liberalism implies individualism) we are free to believe that 
this is the ‘collective’ century, and therefore the century of 
the State.`, answer: "Mussolini"},
{question: `If liberalism spells individualism, Fascism spells government.`, answer: "Mussolini"}
