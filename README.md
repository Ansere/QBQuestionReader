# QBQuestionReader

A PeerJS Quiz-Bowl style question reader made for my UGS Philosophy class. The website does not use a central server. Instead, one of the players acts as the "host" of the room.

## Features
- Create rooms and play with friends
- Reads questions word by word just like in Quiz Bowl.
- Answer questions or talk in chat
- Reassigns the host when they leave
- Supports MCQ and FRQ

## Usage
- Go to https://ansere.github.io/QBQuestionReader/. You should be assigned a room.
- Copy the URL in the address bar and send it to your friends
- Have fun!
